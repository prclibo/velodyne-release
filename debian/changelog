ros-kinetic-velodyne-pointcloud (101.2.1-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * try fixing changelog
  * update
  * point cloud header stamp from gps
  * fixed outer hour denotion
  * workaround version number
  * fixed bug gps time from uint64_t to double
  * timestamp support initialized
  * velodyne_pointcloud: remove incorrect catkin_package() DEPENDS option (#93 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/93>)
    This eliminates a CMake warning when building on Xenial.
  * Added an interface to set up raw data processing from a locally defined calibration file. This method is useful when processing data offline from a bag file, without starting any ros master
  * test multiple nodelet manager support (#108 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/108>)
  * add launch args to support multiple devices (#108 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/108>)
  * Rearranged alphabetically.
  * Remove unused constants.
    DISTANCE_MAX and DISTANCE_MAX_UNITS are not used anywhere in the code.
    Furthermore, using them would lead to errors as both VLP-64 manuals state that returns above 120 m should not be used. The VLP-32 manual allows 70 m as the maximum valid sensor range.
  * Add more options in launch files.
    - rpm, device_ip, port, read_once, read_fast, repeat_delay
  * Fix misleading typecasts.
    intensity and VPoint::intensity are both of type float.
  * update change history
  * Modified velodyne_point_cloud/src/lib/rawdata.cc to address warning
    that last_azimuth_diff variable may be used uninitialized.  Variable
    is now initialized to 0 at creation.
    velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/src/lib/rawdata.cc:328:57: error: ‘last_azimuth_diff’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    azimuth_corrected_f = azimuth + (azimuth_diff * ((dsr*VLP16_DSR_TOFFSET) + (firing*VLP16_FIRING_TOFFSET)) / VLP16_BLOCK_TDURATION);
  * Modified  velodyne_pointcloud/src/conversion/colors.cc to remove
    address build warning for strict-aliasing.
    velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/src/conversions/colors.cc:84:58:
    error: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules [-Werror=strict-aliasing]
    p.rgb = *reinterpret_cast<float*>(&rainbow[color]);
    ^
  * velodyne_pointcloud: Fix compile warning "Wrong initialization order"
  * velodyne_pointcloud: add dynamic reconfig update to change log (#78 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/78>)
  * velodyne_pointcloud: use recommended add_dependencies() CMake variable #78 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/78>
  * velodyne_pointcloud: fix transform unit tests
    Use tf2_ros static_transform_publisher for more consistent timing (#2 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/2>)
  * Merge branch 'reconfigure_transform_node' of https://github.com/fudger/velodyne
  * prepare change history for coming Indigo release (#59 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/59>)
  * calibration: unit test case improvements (#84 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/84>)
  * calibration: read all intensities as float, then convert (#84 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/84>)
  * calibration: add gtest for #84 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/84>
    This currently fails on 64e_s2.1-sztaki.yaml and on issue_84_float_intensities.yaml.
  * calibration: make max_intensity and min_intensity optional (#84 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/84>)
    This fixes a regression in the 32e and VLP-16 calibrations which do not contain
    intensity values. There is still a problem with the 64e_s2.1 calibration.
  * Merge pull request #76 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/76> from pomerlef/master
    Sign inversion in some equations
  * fix the yaml-cpp 0.5 code paths
  * allow horiz_offset_correction to be optional with 0 as default
  * allow floats instead of ints in min/max_intensity
  * Resolve frame ID name using tf prefix.
  * Improve coding style.
  * Set up dynamic reconfiguration for transform_node.
    Previously, transform_node has neither read parameters other than frame_id from the command line nor has it exposed these parameters via dynamic reconfigure. As parameters like max_range and view_width have been initialized to zero, the inconfigurable transform_node has returned an empty point cloud.
    Now, transform_node launches an reconfigure server just as cloud_node. In contrast to cloud_node, transform node exposes another parameter for dynamic reconfiguration: frame_id, i.e. the frame of reference the incoming Velodyne points are transformed to.
  * Add a missing space.
  * Fix line that always indicates use of model VLP-16.
  * Align console output of calibration data.
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne
  * resolve sign error
  * Fix data type error that distorts the point cloud.
  * Fix and add a few comments.
  * Remove unused variable
    I think that dsr was unused. See line 317:
    for (int dsr=0; ...
  * VLP-16: skip badly formatted data packets (#62 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/62>, #63 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/63>)
  * restore VLP-16 min_range setting to 0.4 (#60 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/60>)
    NOTE: There is still some other problem keeping that from working.
  * permit min_range settings below 0.9 meters (#60 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/60>)
    No known models are currently known to return closer measurements.
  * Fixed azimuth overflow bug.
    For interpolated azimuth values between 35999.5 and 36000.0 the nested round(fmod())
    yields a value of 36000 which is invalid and overflows the pre-computed sin/cos arrays,
    since they only go form 0..35999
  * Added vertical sin angle correction
  * Merge pull request #47 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/47> from prclibo/master
    fixed rounding bug in intensity calculation found by songshiyu
  * fixed rounding bug in intensity calculation found by songshiyu
  * fix some overly long C++ source lines
  * missed the space in the file name which caused the build to fail, removed space before extension
  * adding the VLP16 test scripts and updating the CMakeLists to include the test file from http://download.ros.org/data/velodyne/vlp16.pcap
  * adding support for the VLP16
  * fixed point computation according to the 64e_s2(.1) velodyne manual, with luopei"s help
  * fixed gen_calibration min/max intensity type
  * fixed a calibration file parsing bug
  * Fix broken reference to pull request #22 <https://github.com/prclibo/velodyne/issues/22>
